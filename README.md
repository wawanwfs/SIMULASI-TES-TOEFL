## Overview

- Reading Comprehension practice
- Full Test Mode
- Browser Text-to-Speech for Listening
- Timer for each section
- Auto submit when time is up
- Required answers before manual submit
- Stop Test option
- Restart same questions
- Retry with shuffled questions
- Automatic scoring

- JSON-based question bank
- GitHub Pages ready

## TOEFL ITP-like Test Format

The full TOEFL ITP Level 1 format generally consists of:

| Section | Number of Questions | Time |
|---|---:|---:|
| Listening Comprehension | 50 questions | ±35 minutes |
| Structure & Written Expression | 40 questions | 25 minutes |
| Reading Comprehension | 50 questions | 55 minutes |
| **Total** | **140 questions** | **±115 minutes** |

This project currently uses a smaller demo bank:

| Section | Current Demo Questions |
|---|---:|
| Listening | 10 questions |
| Structure | 10 questions |
| Reading | 10 questions |
| **Total** | **30 questions** |

The question bank can be expanded gradually to match the full TOEFL ITP-like format.

## Sections

### 1. Listening Comprehension

The Listening section uses browser-based Text-to-Speech.

Current sample content includes:

- Conversations
- Short talks
- Multiple-choice questions
- Automatic answer checking
- Explanations

Because the audio uses the browser's built-in speech engine, the voice quality may vary depending on the user's browser and device.

### 2. Structure & Written Expression

The Structure section includes:

- Sentence completion
- Error identification
- Grammar-focused explanations

Example topics:

- Subject-verb agreement
- Passive voice
- Prepositions
- Conjunctions
- Parallel structure
- Past participle
- Reduced clauses
- Inversion

### 3. Reading Comprehension

The Reading section includes:

- Academic-style passages
- Main idea questions
- Detail questions
- Inference questions
- Vocabulary-in-context questions
- Author's purpose questions

## Full Test Mode

Full Test Mode allows users to complete sections in sequence:

```text
Listening → Structure → Reading → Final Result

During Full Test Mode:

Section buttons are locked while the test is running.
Users must complete the current section before moving to the next section.
The timer runs independently for each section.
Final results show section scores, total correct answers, accuracy, and estimated TOEFL ITP-like score.
Estimated TOEFL ITP-like Score

The website provides an estimated TOEFL ITP-like score using a simplified conversion method.

Estimated section scale:

Listening: 31–68
Structure: 31–68
Reading: 31–67

Estimated total score:

((Listening Scale + Structure Scale + Reading Scale) × 10) / 3

Estimated level:

Estimated Score	Level
Below 343	Below A2 / Basic
343–432	A2 / Elementary
433–542	B1 / Intermediate
543–619	B2 / Upper Intermediate
620–677	C1 / Advanced
